## Overview

Precaution provides simple, automated code reviews for GitHub projects by running
code linters with a security focus on all pull requests.

GitHub integration is made through the GitHub app interface and the checks API (beta),
which allows results to be presented directly as inline annotations instead of
a pass/fail status report.


Precaution currently supports analysis of python files via Bandit. New languages may be added in future.

## Installing Precaution on a GitHub repository

1. You can install Precaution from here: https://github.com/apps/precaution

2. Then choose the profile you want to connect Precaution with.

3. Next you have to choose which repositories you want to enable Precaution on. 

4. Review and accept the permissions for the GitHub app. These are the minimal permissions required to read the pull request contents
and communicate with the checks API.
 
5. Done! Now Precaution is installed on your repositories.

## Setting up a manual deployment

This requires two distinct steps: setting up the environment and dependencies, and registering a GitHub application pointing to your own running copy.

### Install dependencies

#### Python and Bandit

1. Make sure Python is installed 
2. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Go and Gosec

1. Install Go if you haven't already: https://golang.org/doc/install 
2. Download the latest version of gosec:
```go get github.com/securego/gosec```
3. Add $GOPATH/bin into your PATH:
```export PATH=$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin```
4. Add the work folder to your gopath:
```export GOPATH=$GOPATH:$(pwd)/cache/go```

### Register the app

Please refer to the [GitHub app documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-your-first-github-app/#one-time-setup) to get started on registering your own running instance of the app.

This app requires the following **GitHub permissions** :
* Checks: **Read** and **Write**
* Pull requests: **Read**
* Code: **Read**

Additionnally the app should subscribe to the **Pull requests** event.

### Redirect Github webhooks to your local machine

This can be useful when you are doing development work on Precaution itself and need a simple solution to trace the webhooks sent by GitHub and receive them without exposing your app to the internet.

Please refer to the [Probot documentation](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app)
to direct GitHub webhooks to your local machine.

### Testing

Run ```npm test``` or ```yarn test```. This does not require any GitHub interaction (no need to register an instance of the app).
