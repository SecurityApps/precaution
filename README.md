## Overview

Frisk provides a simple, automated code review for GitHub projects by running
code linters with a security focus on pull requests.

GitHub integration is made through the GitHub app interface and the checks API (beta),
which allows results to be presented directly as inline annotations instead of
a pass/fail status report.


Frisk supports analysis of python files via Bandit. New languages may be added in future.

## Set up Frisk

1. You can install Frisk from here: [ weblink to Frisk app installation ]

2. Then choose the profile you want to connect Frisk with.

3. Next you have to choose over which repositories do you want to use Frisk on. 

4. Below that read carefully what kind of data Frisk needs to operate. 
We guarantee that we use minimal amount of permissions and all of them are connected with the functionality of Frisk. No information will be leaked!
 
5. Done! Now Frisk is installed.

2. Download the latest version of gosec from here: https://github.com/securego/gosec/releases
3. Make sure your GOPATH variable is set to the proper path
4. Add $GOPATH/bin into your PATH environmental variable. 


### Deployment

This app requires the following **GitHub permissions** :
* Checks: **Read** and **Write**
* Pull requests: **Read**
