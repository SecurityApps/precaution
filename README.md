## Overview

Frisk provides a simple, automated code review for GitHub projects by running
code linters with a security focus on pull requests.

GitHub integration is made through the GitHub app interface and the checks API (beta),
which allows results to be presented directly as inline annotations instead of
a pass/fail status report.


Frisk supports analysis of python files via Bandit. New languages may be added in future.

## Set up Frisk

1. You can install Frisk from here: [ weblink to Frisk app installation ]

2. Then choose the profile you want to connect Frisk with.

3. Next you have to choose over which repositories do you want to use Frisk on. 

4. Below that read carefully what kind of data Frisk needs to operate. 
We guarantee that we use minimal amount of permissions and all of them are connected with the functionality of Frisk. No information will be leaked!
 
5. Done! Now Frisk is installed.


## Local development setup


Please refer to the [Probot documentation](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app)
to direct GitHub webhooks to your local machine.

Additionally make sure python is installed and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Deployment

This app requires the following **GitHub permissions** :
* Checks: **Read** and **Write**
* Pull requests: **Read**
* Code: **Read**

Additionnally the app should subscribe to the **Pull requests** event.

### Testing

Run ```npm test``` or ```yarn test```. This does not require any GitHub interaction (no need to register an instance of the app).
