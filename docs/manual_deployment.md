# Setting up a manual deployment

This requires two distinct steps: setting up the environment and dependencies, and registering a GitHub application pointing to your own running copy.

## Clone Precaution locally

You have to clone the Precaution source code in order to run it locally.

1. Go to the directory where you want to clone Precaution.
2. Make sure you have installed Git and run ```git clone https://github.com/vmware/precaution.git```
3. ``cd precaution``

## Install dependencies

### Python and Bandit

1. Make sure Python2/Python3 is installed.
2. Make sure that pip/pip3 is installed.
3. From the root directory of the project run:
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` respectively

### Go and Gosec

1. Install Go if you haven't already: https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Add $GOPATH/bin into your PATH:
```export PATH=$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin```
3. Add the work folder to your GOPATH:
```export GOPATH=$GOPATH:$(pwd)/cache/go```
4. Download the latest version of gosec:

```
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securego/gosec/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $GOPATH/bin 1.3.0
```
binary will be $GOPATH/bin/gosec

### Nodejs

1. Download Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Make sure you have installed npm
3. Run ```npm install```

## Register the app

Please refer to the [GitHub app documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-your-first-github-app/#one-time-setup) to get started on registering your own running instance of the app.

This app requires the following **GitHub permissions** :
* Checks: **Read** and **Write**
* Pull requests: **Read**
* Code: **Read**

Additionnally the app should subscribe to the **Pull requests** event.

## Redirect Github webhooks to your local machine

This can be useful when you are doing development work on Precaution itself and need a simple solution to trace the webhooks sent by GitHub and receive them without exposing your app to the internet.

Please refer to the [Probot documentation](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app)
to direct GitHub webhooks to your local machine.

## Testing

Run ```npm test```. This does not require any GitHub interaction (no need to register an instance of the app).
