# Redirect Github webhooks to your local machine

This can be useful when you are doing development work on Precaution itself and need a simple solution to trace the webhooks sent by GitHub and receive them without exposing your app to the internet.

Please refer to the [Probot documentation](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) to direct GitHub webhooks to your local machine.
